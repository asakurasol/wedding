      <h3>
        How They Met
      </h3>

      <p>Smita and Derek met on an normal day while going about their normal day to day activities. They began chatting about the weather or something while waiting routinely for the bus, and after talking for a normal amount of time they decided to have lunch together. Meeting at an ordinary restaurant with normal food, they quickly learned that they had many, but not strangely many, interests in common, and they wanted to see each other again, which is totally normal. Since then, they have spent a normal amount of time together, mostly doing chores, running errands, and other normal things.</p>

        The Proposal
      </h3>

      <p>
        After a normal amount of time, Derek decided to ask Smita to marry him. On a normal day much like the day they met, Derek popped the question. “Will you marry me?” he asked, while dusting his acceptably sized book collection. “Ok”, Smita said casually, looking up from her newspaper. Showing a perfectly normal amount of joy, they both looked forward to all the chores and errands they would need to take care of for their wedding, and for the rest of their lives together.

        How They Met
      </h3>

      <p>Smita and Derek met as extras on the set of the first episode of How I Met Your Mother. They were supposed to be pretend-talking in the background while the main characters had a conversation, but they ended up having a real conversation themselves and were thrown off the set for being too loud. They continued talking on their way out of the studio and ended up ruining takes for three other shows on the lot.</p>

        The Proposal

      <p>
        Derek proposed to Smita on the top of a lighthouse as the last step of an elaborate list of things he planned since they first met. Everyone watching thought it was the most legendary proposal they had ever seen, and they all cried.

      <h3>
        How They Met
      </h3>

      <p>Smita was a personal doctor working for the De Niall’s, a wealthy family in upstate New York when she met Derek, their family lawyer, by accident. The owners of the house, Amin and Yorine De Niall had just returned from their vacation only to find Amin’s con man uncle Yallin waiting in their home with his butler. Yallin proclaimed that he had tricked their recently deceased parents, who died in a plane accident while returning from vacation, into leaving most of their wealth to uncle Yallin in their will. The De Naills were caught off guard, and after a series of violent stares and gasps, they called Derek to their home to help fight Yallin with a lawsuit. Derek was making detailed notes of the will when suddenly the De Nialls’ long lost son Therin came through their door. Therin was thrown overboard during a family cruise when he was a boy, and no one had seen or heard from him since. The family was delirious with joy to be reunited with their son, and Derek happily realized that the will said that legally all the family money now technically belonged to Therin, and Yallin no longer had any claim! As Yallin stormed off angrily, Therin suddenly fell deathly ill on the doorsteps, just as he entered the home. Distraught, the De Naills called Smita to save their long lost son from this mysterious illness. However, Smita was suspicious about his symptoms, and she uncovered that Therin was actually faking his illness! With a quick googling, Smita and Derek uncovered that Therin was actually an impostor, hired by Yallin as part of a sneaky trick to claim all the inheritance for himself. Smita, while dramatically exposing him as a fraud in front of everyone, noticed a strange but familiar birthmark on Yallin’s butler’s hand. She spoke to the butler, “As a doctor, I have to ask you a question. How have you been dealing with your amnesia?” Startled, the butler marveled at her perception. He replied “Why, I don’t remember telling you about my amnesia!” This confirmed Smita’s hunch, and she revealed that the butler was in fact the real Therin, who had been right under their noses for years! After Smita pointed out the birthmark as proof, Therin remembered a bit of his past for the first time and switched sides to rejoin his true parents. Armed with Yallin’s secrets, he told everyone that Yallin was actually secretly adopted and could never inherit anything anyway! With the day finally saved for good, Smita and Derek decided that they had finally had enough of this ridiculous family and found new jobs in California.</p>

      <h3>
        The Proposal
      </h3>

      <p>
        Derek proposed to Smita in an ultra fancy french restaurant that only high powered lawyers know about. Smita was about say yes, when a second man who looked and dressed exactly like Derek burst through the door. “Stop!” he shouted, “That’s not the real me! That’s my evil twin Beric, trying to steal my identity! He kidnapped me when you weren’t looking, and he took my place!” Seeing that his deception was revealed, Beric stood up and pulled out a gun out of his coat. Derek charged him, and the two men tumbled, fighting for the gun. Eventually they both lost control and the gun flew to Smita. Both of them got up and yelled “NO! Don’t shoot me! Shoot him!” and pointed at each other. Smita wavered her gun between the two Dereks, frantically searching for clues to determine their real identities, when she suddenly found a plan. “Listen to me, both of you,” she said, “This whole thing is ridiculous. Why don’t I just call the police and we can do a fingerprint test or something?” she said calmly. “That way, there’s no risk of me shooting the wrong guy accidentally, duh.” The two Dereks looked at each other. “No! There’s no time, his men will be here any minute! Look into my eyes! Can’t you tell it’s the real me?” pleaded one Derek, while the other said “Hmm, yeah that’s actually a pretty reasonable idea. Let’s just do that.” BANG! The real Derek ducked and looked around nervously. “What, I thought we were going to call the police” he said, confused. “Don’t worry about it” Smita replied, and they lived happily ever after.

        How They Met
      </h3>

      <p>Smita and Derek first met at a Subway outside of BossFest, a convention dedicated to fans of the 80’s hit series “Who’s the Boss?” Initially arguing over who on the show was, in fact, the boss, Smita and Derek came to accept the other’s position and became friends. They later saw each other again at the opening of the science museum exhibit “Quantum Chaos Theory: Inspecting Space and Time.” At first they thought this was just a coincidence, but they ran into each other yet again at GameKnight, a meetup for people who regularly play Dungeons and Dragons as Batman. They finally realized that fate was bringing them together when they both attended a support group for people who believe that there are evil versions of themselves from an alternate universe who are always stealing their pens. Since they started dating, they have enjoyed spending their time together making independent films, taking pottery classes at their local community college, and watching way too much television.</p>

      <h3>
        The Proposal
      </h3>

      <p>
        Derek proposed to Smita by elaborately tricking Smita into signing up for a fake pottery course from a fake professor. When she showed up for the first day, Smita saw that someone had hung a small gift wrapped box near the ceiling and put a trampoline on the floor. Deciding to seize the day, Smita jumped on the trampoline until she could reach the box, and inside she found a key and a room number. The key led to another classroom in which Derek had set up a massive pillow fort maze, with a wedding ring at the center. When Smita came out of the maze, Derek was there waiting, and he proposed to her. Smita was so overwhelmed, that all she could keep saying the whole time was “Cool.”

        How They Met
      </h3>

      <p>Smita was a master spy for Ikea, the shadowy organization that is secretly running the world, when she met Derek, a ninja bound by blood oath to serve her worst enemy, Bed, Bath & Beyond. After an epic battle, they came to grudgingly respect each other, and starting dating. Derek’s masters disapproved of a relationship between their top ninja and their archenemy, and they ordered him to kill Smita. Derek refused to stop seeing Smita, but was also bound by his blood oath and kept his relationship a secret. His masters eventually found out, and attacked Derek and Smita with an army of ninjas while they were at a Krispy Kreme, which is considered holy territory by every secret shadow organization. In violation of the shadow neutrality laws, Derek’s masters became the enemy of everyone in the Krispy Kreme, and the greatest battle ever fought in the great Shadow War began. It ended with only Derek and Smita left against Sensei Alexander Bath, the last remaining and most powerful of Derek’s three masters. With a tag team double flip maneuver involving a skateboard and a nearby exploding fire truck, Derek and Smita defeated Sensei Bath. Now free from his blood oath, Derek was able to live on his own terms and Derek and Smita decided to retire from their shadow lives. They now lead ordinary lives, though they keep up their skills for the inevitable future invasion by Hello Kitty.</p>

      <h3>
        The Proposal
      </h3>

      <p>
        Derek proposed to Smita by giving her one of her favorite things from her childhood, an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine. He began by crashing a fancy car into a fruit stand, setting off a carefully planned chain of events. The fruit caused a nearby community of raccoons to swoop on the scene, and the hungry raccoons were channeled through the bottom of a waterwheel. The wheel began turning, and a system of gears and pulleys caused a construction worker’s platform to be slowly winched up. When the platform got to the top of the building, it tipped over a carefully placed slab of concrete on the top of the construction site, which then crashed into numerous other slabs like dominos. The last slab hit a large pane of glass placed at the edge of the building, and the falling shards poured over a rope that was holding a cart of molten steel suspended in the air. Eventually, the rope was cut, and the steel tipped over and fell into a series of channels Derek had dug, spelling out a glowing red  “Will you marry me” in the ground. From her lookout on a hill, Smita saw all the events unfold, and answered yes as Derek pulled up in his fruit covered car.

        How They Met
      </h3>

      <p>As a young and inexperienced Pokemon trainer, Smita was exploring the Seafoam Islands one day, hoping to find and catch some new Pokemon for her collection. Her thoughts of finally catching them all were interrupted when suddenly a wild Derek appeared! “Derek, Derek!” cried Derek, unaware of Smita’s presence as he stumbled nearby. Unfazed, Smita sent out her trusty Squirtle to help her capture this new and unusual Pokemon. Derek turned, and was transfixed as he saw Smita for the first time, ready for battle with her Squirtle. “Derek!” he yelled, as he began flailing his arms about wildly. This was not very effective. Remembering her training, Smita saw that this Derek was already on the verge of fainting, and she quickly threw a Pokeball at him. “Ow! That hurt!” said Derek as the Pokeball hit his head. “Wait, where am I?” he wondered aloud, looking around as if seeing his surroundings for the first time. Surprised, Smita marveled at her discovery of this talking Pokemon. “I’m going to be the most famous Pokemon trainer of all time!” she thought, as she reached for another Pokeball from her bag. “Wait! Stop!” Derek exclaimed, “I’m not a Pokemon! I’m a Pokemon trainer like you!” Derek explained to Smita that he was trying to capture a Slowpoke when he was accidentally stricken by amnesia, and has no memory of how he got there. With thoughts of fame and fortune still lingering in her head, Smita decided that although she didn’t completely buy his story, she would let this mysterious Pokemon go for now while she learned more about him. From then on, Smita and Derek have been inseparable in their journeys together, although every once in a while Smita still throws a Pokeball at him just in case.</p>

      <h3>
        The Proposal
      </h3>

      <p>
        Despite all the Pokeball related headaches and that time Smita tried to make him evolve with a Moon stone, Derek knew from their adventures together that Smita was the one for him. He decided to propose to Smita, and he wanted to do it according to the traditions of his hometown. He found a large acorn in the forest, carved it into a special engagement Pokeball, and embedded a rare and expensive gem that would give her Pokemon +10 happiness. When it was finally ready, he wrapped it in a bow, got down on one knee, and threw the ball at Smita. “I choose you!” he yelled, in the traditional Pokemon trainer fashion, and Smita accepted.
