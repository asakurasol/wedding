    <h3>
      How They Met
    </h3>

    <p>Smita and Derek met on an ordinary day while going about their normal day to day activities. They began chatting about the weather while waiting routinely for the bus, and after talking for an average amount of time they decided to have lunch together. Meeting at a non descript restaurant with perfectly acceptable food, they quickly learned that they had many, but not too many, interests in common, and they wanted to see each other again, which is totally normal. Since then, they have spent an ordinary amount of time together, mostly doing chores, running errands, and other normal things.</p>

    <h3>
      The Proposal
    </h3>

    <p>
      After an average amount of time, Derek decided to ask Smita to marry him. On a day much like they day they met, Derek popped the question. “Will you marry me?” he asked, while dusting his acceptably sized book collection. “Ok”, Smita said normally, looking up from her newspaper. Showing perfectly reasonable amounts of joy, they both looked forward to all the chores and errands they would need to take care of for their wedding, and for the rest of their lives together.
